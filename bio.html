  <p> "Everyday life is like pregramming, if you love something you
                      can put beauty into it"
       This is the quote that Sujina truly believes in. She believes
       that nothing becomes worthless if you add some effort and
       passion to it.

       Currently, Sujina is a student, you can call her a 'fresher' as
       she is the first year student of Bsc hons computing in NAMI
       college. She is really into sketching, baking and also into the world of "IT".
       She finds computing interesting because learning new apps in her mobile phone
       is one of the most fascinating things for her.What can get more amazing
       for her than being able to create them all by herself, right?
       She calls herself to be a reserved kind of person but still enjoys
       the company of those who she loves. She takes her parents as her biggest
       inpiration in order to face challenges. She says" the hardest time of
       my life was when I was in my high school at United Academy because
       I had chosen Science faculty and it was truly not my cup of tea.I
       did not enjoy what I was learning, I wanted to learn by understanding and
       by technique, not just by mugging up."
       The proud moment for her was when she completed her school in the year
       2014 in good grade. Her current aim  is to be happy of what she doing and
       where she is right now and her future plan is be become a software
       Engineer.
